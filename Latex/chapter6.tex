\section{Overview} 
This chapter outlines the outcomes of the cooperative spectrum sensing using soft and hard decision fusion schemes. The $P_{davg}$ vs $SNR$ plot is generated for both the schemes to compare their performance in a real fading scenario on a hardware test-bed. The data files generated using gnuradio are imported in MATLAB for all sensor nodes and the results are derived. As it is expected soft-fusion schemes outperform hard-fusion scheme but as we go to higher SNRs both the schemes generally converges to the same results. For LTE-R performance analysis we have the plot for K-factor variation inside a tunnel for high speed tunnel. We also generated the ber curves for all three modulation schemes proposed for LTE-R and it is evident from the plots for higher K-values we have good connectivity. As the train moves away from the LCXs slot, the K-factor goes down and bit-error rate increases. Finally, we generated the continuous ber curve to test the performance of LTE-R in a discrete timestep manner.
