\section{Summary}
This chapter discussed the implementation fall-backs and successes of the BLISS system.  The entire AS\textsuperscript{6} system was outlined and scrutinized for feasibility and operational performance.  Spectral Subtraction and Signal Separation were transitioned from original research goals to more manageable problems, with simplified solutions.  Overall it can be said that optimality and technical complexity were sacrificed in the end for realizability.  Many directions needed to be changed, especially in the Signal Separation block, and constraints needed to be tightened on the Spectral Subtraction block.  Although AntSS couldn't be realized a solid foundation exists for future work.\\
