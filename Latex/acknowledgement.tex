I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor Professor Alexander Wyglinski for his continuous guidance and support towards my course of degree. I am very thankful for the opportunity to work with him in Wireless Innovation Laboratory at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 

I want to thank Professor Kaveh Pahlavan and Dr. Travis Collins for serving on my committee and providing valuable suggestions and comments with regards to my thesis. 

I would also like to thank my WILab team members Dr. Srikanth Pagadarai, Dr. Paulo Ferreira, Renato, Le and my friends Rasika, Devdip and Raunak for their immense support during my graduate studies. Finally, I'm also thankful to my parents, without their constant support I wouldn't be here.
