\chapter{Proposed LTE-R Channel Model and Framework}
\label{chapter4}

This chapter proposes a new model for LTE-R communication system operation in tunnel environments. Severe channel impairments inside a tunnel such as high Doppler shift caused by the high velocities of trains and harsh multipath fading environment are incorporated in the proposed model. In particular, a two-ray propagation channel model is discussed and mathematical derivations of the $K$-factor is described. The LTE-R test-bed implementation in MATLAB is presented and a performance comparison is conducted for QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM modulation schemes in a tunnel environment. The results of $K$-factor variation in a tunnel environment for a high speed trains. Using the $K$-factor, we can implement our channel model, which also takes into effect the high Doppler shift due to the mobility of the train. The bit-error rate curves are generated for the LTE-R modulation schemes for the proposed channel model of a high speed train in a tunnel. Finally, we show a time-varying BER curve for high speed train moving with the velocity $v$ at discrete timesteps.

\section{Channel Impairments Inside a Tunnel}
Tunnel environments are affected by multipath and diffraction effects due to multiple reflections from the tunnel walls, which leads to a substantial fading environment. By deploying LCX cables, we can eliminate the large penetration loss due to tunnel walls. However, small-scale fading can still cause a large amount of errors and decrease the QoS for a communication link. High velocity trains experience very high Doppler shifts and fast fading. These problems can lead to significant BER degradation of the LTE system. The frequency shifts caused by the Doppler phenomenon can lead to shifts in the sub-carrier frequencies for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), which leads to synchronization errors~\cite{inplter9}. The maximum Doppler shifts for a train traveling at 500 km/h is 2.314 kHz for a 5 GHz carrier frequency. This large Doppler shift can also lead to significant drops in the quality of wireless signals and increase the bit error rate. Thus, to develop an efficient and reliable communication link inside tunnels, we need to properly model this channel impairment and build our proposed channel model by taking into account these tunnel phenomena.

Wireless signals reflect off the objects in path while traveling from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna, creating multiple paths of the wireless signal. This leads to multipath in the wireless communication system. The following time-varying multipath channel impulse response considers the effects of Doppler shift and scattering~\cite{booklter13}:
\begin{equation}
\label{channel}
{h}(\tau,t)= \sum_{k=0}^{L}{h_k}(t)e^{-j2\pi f_c\tau_k(t)}\delta[\tau-\tau_k(t)],
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the path delay, $t$ is time in seconds, $\delta[\tau-\tau_k(t)]$ is the impulse response, $f_c$ is the carrier frequency, $h_k(t)$ is the envelope of the time-varying channel and consists of both large and small-scale fading components. Since the structure of LCX is almost the same as a leaky waveguide, the large scale fading of channel can be modeled linearly~\cite{arlter10}. There is also no signal shadowing and the line-of-sight (LOS) signal component is always present along the tunnel. This type of channel fading can be best described by a Ricean fading model. The probability density function $p(\alpha)$ of a Rician fading model is given by~\cite{inplter12}:
\begin{equation}
p(\alpha) = \dfrac{2\alpha(1+K)}{\Omega}I_0\Bigg(2\alpha\sqrt{\dfrac{K+K^2}{\Omega}}\Bigg)e^{\dfrac{-K-\alpha^2(1+K)}{\Omega}},
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the Rician factor and $\alpha$ is the complex amplitude of the channel response function that has a unity second moment, \textit{i.e.}, $\Omega \equiv E[\alpha^2] = 1$.

The Doppler effect is observed whenever the signal source is moving with respect to the receiver. When the signal source is approaching the receiver there is a positive frequency drift, and negative frequency drift when the source is moving away. The 3GPP channel model~\cite{trlter14} is used for its Doppler shift profile in high speed railway environment. The measurements obtained for the Doppler frequency shift are implemented for two scenarios. The first scenario is for an open space while the second scenario is for high speed trains. Doppler shift is not taken into consideration. There exists a third scenario for tunnels using multiple antennas. Since the slots of the LCX can be modeled as multiple antenna system, we use this Doppler shift profile for our proposed channel. The Doppler shift variation $f_s(t)$ is described by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq1}
f_s(t) = f_d\cos\theta(t),
\end{equation}
where \textrm{$f_d$} is the maximum Doppler shift, $\theta$ is the elevation angle and $\cos \theta(t)$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta(t) = 
\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
	 & \dfrac{D_s/2-vt}{\sqrt{\mathrm{D_{min}}^2+\bigg((D_s/2)-vt\bigg)^2}},0\leq t\leq\dfrac{D_s}{v}\\
	 & \dfrac{-1.5D_s+vt}{\sqrt{\mathrm{D_{min}}^2+\bigg((-1.5D_s)-vt\bigg)^2}},\dfrac{D_s}{v}\leq t \leq \dfrac{2D_s}{v}\\
 	\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
where $D_s/2$ is the initial distance of the train from base-station, and $D_{min}$ is base-station (BS)-Railway track distance, both in meters, $v$ is the velocity of the train in \textrm{m/s}, and $t$ is time in seconds.

\label{doppler}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{doppler} shows the Doppler spectrum for $f_c$ = 5 GHz and $v$ = 300 Km/h, 400 Km/h and 500 Km/h, and as we can see in the figure the maximum Doppler shift range is from -2.314 kHz to +2.314 kHz. These ranges of Doppler shift values can lead to very high bit-error rate and poor connectivity in communication system. In the following section, we discuss our proposed channel model that consists of Doppler shift profile for high speed train and dynamic $K$-factor for tunnel environment.

\section{Proposed Channel Model}
The tunnel measurement campaign conducted in the paper~\cite{inplter8} shows that the amplitude variation inside a tunnel follows Rician distribution. In the thesis, we apply the approach used in~\cite{inlter15} for single elevation angle $\theta$ and expand it to a time-varying case. In this thesis, we model $\theta$ as a function of time and derive the time-series $K$-factor for the tunnel environment. Figure~\ref{subblock} describes our proposed channel model, which is implemented using dynamic $K$-factor and Doppler shift profile derived using Eq.~(\ref{eq1}). We now discuss the classical two-ray propagation model and a mathematically derive dynamic $K$-factor for our proposed channel model. Figure~\ref{tworay} describes the two ray propagation model in an open free space path-loss environment where the transmitter is in direct line-of-sight (LOS) of the receiver station.

\end{figure}

The reflection coefficient $\Gamma$~\cite{booklter16} as a function of time $t$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(t) = \dfrac{C\sin\theta(t)-\sqrt{(\varepsilon_r-j\chi(t))-(\cos\theta(t))^2}}{C\sin\theta(t)-\sqrt{(\varepsilon_r-j\chi(t))-(\cos\theta(t))^2}},
\end{equation}
where $C = 1$ is for horizontal polarization, and $C = \varepsilon_r-j\chi(t)$ for vertical polarization. Furthermore, $\chi(t)$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\chi(t) = \dfrac{\sigma}{\omega(t)\varepsilon_0} = \dfrac{\sigma}{2\pi f_r(t) \varepsilon_0} = \dfrac{1.8\times 10^{10}\sigma}{f_r(t)}.
\end{equation}
with $\varepsilon_0 = 8.854\times 10^{-12}~\textrm{F/m}$, and $\sigma$ is conductivity of the tunnel. The frequency $f_r(t)$ is the resultant frequency caused by the Doppler shift and is given by:
\begin{equation}
f_r(t) = f_c(t)-f_s(t)
\end{equation}
where $f_c(t)$ is the sub-carrier frequency, and $f_s(t)$ is the Doppler shift given by Eq.~(\ref{eq1}).

The phase difference function of $t$, $\Delta\phi(t)$, between the two reflected paths is given by~\cite{booklter11}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta\phi(t) =& \dfrac{2\pi}{\lambda(t)}\bigg(\sqrt{D_{\textrm{LOS}}^2+(h_t+h_r)^2}-\\
& \sqrt{D_{\textrm{LOS}}^2+(h_t-h_r)^2}\bigg),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda(t)$ is the resultant time-varying wavelength at the receiver, $D_{\textrm{LOS}}$ is the distance between the transmitter and receiver antennas which is changing dynamically with $t$, and both $h_t$ and $h_r$ are the heights of the transmitter and receiver antennas, respectively.
 
The resultant received power $p_r(t)$ is given by the sum of the LOS received power plus the received multipath power, yielding:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
p_r(t) =& ~p_t(t)\bigg(\dfrac{\lambda}{4\pi d}\bigg)^2G_t G_r\bigg[1+\\
& |\Gamma(t)|^2+2|\Gamma(t)|\cos(\angle\Gamma(t)-\angle\Delta\phi(t))\bigg],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is a function of the transmitter power $p_t(t)$ and the reflection coefficient $\Gamma(t)$, where $G_t$ and $G_r$ are the transmitter and receiver antenna gains,  respectively.
The $K$-factor is defined as the ratio of the direct path power and the power in the scattered paths, and is given as:
\begin{equation}
\label{kfactor}
\mathrm{K}(t) = \dfrac{1}{|\Gamma(t)|^2+2|\Gamma(t)|\textrm{cos}(\angle \Gamma(t)-\Gamma(t)\Delta\Phi(t))}
\end{equation}

\section{LTE-R Simulation Testbed in MATLAB}
We have implemented the simulation testbed in MATLAB, consisting of a transmitter, a channel, and a receiver. The $K$-factor values for the channel model are obtained from Eq~.(\ref{kfactor}) and are used to generate a time-series BER curve for different modulation schemes used in LTE-R. The values used for the electrical material properties for tunnel walls~\cite{lter17} and its specifications are given in Table~\ref{tablelter}. The relative permittivity for the tunnel walls is taken as $\varepsilon_r = 5$ and $\sigma$ is set to 0.1. The simulation is conducted for velocity of $v = $ 300, 400 and 500 Km/h. Since the frequency band allocation for LTE-R will most probably be from 2--6 GHz, hence the $f_c$ values chose are 2, 3 and 5 GHz. The height of the receiver is assumed to be around the length of the train and height of tunnel is chosen as the size of the leaky coaxial cable.

\label{finalblock}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{finalblock} shows the block diagram of the simulation test-bed used for the performance analysis of LTE-R. The random source block generate the symbol between 0 and $M-1$, where $M = 4,16,64$ for QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM, respectively. The data is then modulated with specific modulation type and then pass through the proposed HST channel model. The additive white Gaussian noise is added after applying the channel coefficients to the signal data. We then demodulate the data packets and pass it to the ber calculator object which then computes the bit-error rate. The simulations are run for SNR values ranging from 0--20 dB and plots are generated for all three modulation schemes.

\section{HST LTE-R in Tunnel Environments}
Using the LTE System Toolbox~\cite{ltetoolbox} provided by MATLAB, we generated Figure~\ref{lteofdma}, which shows the received resource grid without equalization. The frame worth of data was modulated with QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM for equal number of subcarriers and mapped to symbol in a subframe. We generate ten subframes individually and create one frame after merging all subframes. The frame is passed through our proposed high speed train channel model, with additive white Gaussian noise added. We can see that without equalization the received resourced grid has lot of errors and will lead to numerous retransmissions.

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{kfactor}, we calculated the $K$-factor for the HST inside a tunnel with velocity $v$ = 500 km/h for different center frequencies. It shows the variation of the Rician $K$-factor with the distance between the transmitter and receiver increasing as the train is moving through the tunnel. We computed the $K$-factor for a leaky cable with periodic slots separated by distance $d$ in fixed time-steps. The plot shows the $K$-factor varies significantly over short distances. Therefore, assuming a single $K$-factor for the channel model is not accurate, we use time-series $K$-factor to do our channel modeling.

\caption{K-factor versus $D_{LOS}$ for different center frequencies $f_c$ = 2, 3 and 5 GHz.}
\label{kfactor}
\end{figure}

To show the impact of varying $K$-factor on the channel, we computed the BER curve for different modulation schemes of LTE-R with different $K$-factors. Figure.~\ref{fig:qpsk} shows the BER versus SNR performance for QPSK modulation for different $K$-factors of the tunnel channel model. The figure demonstrates that for higher $K$-factor we have a better performance while the performance degrades as $K$-factor decreases. Figure.\ref{fig:qam16} shows the $E_b/N_0$ versus BER for 16-QAM, which possesses a BER that is higher when compared to QPSK. Figure.~\ref{fig:qam64} shows the $E_b/N_0$ versus BER for 64-QAM for different $K$-factors. Finally, we compare all the modulation schemes for the best and worst $K$-factor in Figure.~\ref{fig:qamall}.

\label{fig:modulation}      
   \end{center}
\end{figure}

In Figure.~\ref{kfactorber}, we calculate the BER performance for a high speed train in discrete time-steps. As the train moves towards the LCX slot, the SNR goes high and the SNR decreases as the train moves away. This trend can be observed in the plot, as we are moving towards the LCX slot the BER decreases and once we move away from the slot BER starts increasing. It is important to consider here that due to the varying nature of the $K$-factor the BER curve also varies significantly. Hence, by considering the time-varying nature of $K$-factor we can have a better performance analysis.

\section{Summary}
We analyzed the BER performance of a LTE-R system for high speed trains inside tunnel environments using our proposed channel model. We derived the time-series $K$-factor using the classical two-ray propagation model. Using the time-series $K$-factor we build our channel model to test the LTE-R communication system for the HSR. We analyzed the LTE-R performance under the channel model for different modulation schemes for various $K$-factors.
