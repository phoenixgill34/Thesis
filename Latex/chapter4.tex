\section{Summary}

This chapter outlined and examined the topics of jamming and anti-jamming techniques, and provided a foundation in communication system theory and advanced equalizer design.  Secondly it setup an understanding of Software-Defined Radio, the power of such an architecture, and examples of implementations and existing software for future designs.  Next, this thesis will consider a new anti-jamming technique and design an implementation of such a system.  After the implementation is investigated, the result of specific experiments on such an implementation will be analyzed.\\
