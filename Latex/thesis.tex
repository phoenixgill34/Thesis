I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor Professor Alexander Wyglinski for his continuous guidance and support towards my degree. I am very thankful for the opportunity to work with him in the Wireless Innovation Laboratory at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 

I want to thank Professor Kaveh Pahlavan and Dr. Travis Collins for serving on my committee and providing valuable suggestions and comments with regards to my thesis. 

I would also like to thank my WILab team members Dr. Srikanth Pagadarai, Dr. Paulo Ferreira, Renato, Le for their immense support during my graduate studies. And I would also like to thank my friends Rasika, Devdip and Raunak for their constant emotional support. Finally, I'm also thankful to my parents, without their constant support I wouldn't be here.
